During their break from school or work, students work on a 3-5 month project with an open source initiative. Student participants are partnered with a mentor from the leads of successful projects as part of iNeuron Code Fusion , gaining exposure to real-world software development and practices. Students can earn a stipend while working on projects that are linked to their interests over the summer between semesters. As a result, iNeuron aids in the identification of new developers who will implement new features and, perhaps, continue to contribute to open source long after the program has ended. Most significantly, more code is written and released for everyone's benefit. What is iNeuron Code Fusion ? iNeuron Code Fusion ( iCF ) is a global program that connects students, industry, incubators, researchers, innovator and developer community with open source, free software, and technology-related initiatives where they can develop a solution and contribute to the open-source community while getting various rewards and recognitions along with opportunity to win prizes. Mentors from iNeuron serve as advisors throughout the process, from learning about the community to contributing code. The goal is to engage student and industry to build state of the art things and take the advantages. Accepted students and industry will get a platform where they can innovate collaborate work on state of the art projects and build end to end solution for community as well as individual industry. Participating organizations are able to identify and recruit new developers into their communities, with the intention that they will remain active long after their iCF year has ended. Most importantly, more source code is written and released for the benefit of all. All the work done as part of the program is released under an open source licence. How great is it that you get to work on a project that can be used by people all across the world? Program Objectives The iCF program has a number of objectives: Motivate young developers to be involved in open source development. Assist open source projects in identifying and recruiting new contributors. More open source code should be produced and shared for everyone's benefit. Allow students to work on projects that are connected to their academic goals. Give students more hands-on experience with software development in the real world (for example, distributed development and version control, software licencing issues, testing, and communication best practices).","title":"Home"},{"location":"#ineuron-code-fusion-icf","text":"","title":"iNeuron Code Fusion (iCF)"},{"location":"#about","text":"iNeuron Code Fusion is a global program that allows you to submit a research proposal concept and collaborate on open source software development with student developers.

We provide you the chance to assess your mentor's performance. This is also an opportunity for your mentor to assess you. It should not be surprising if an evaluation results in a pass or fail. You and your mentor should already be interacting, and you should be talking about the quality of your code, your involvement in the community, and your progress on your project thus far. If you aren't getting this kind of feedback, you should request it. How Do Evaluation Work? During the evaluation period, you and your mentor will both fill out an evaluation survey. iNeuron makes the evaluation questions available to both students and mentors ahead of time. The webapp you used to submit your project proposal at the start of the term is utilized to administer evaluations. It will take roughly 10-15 minutes to complete the evaluations. The questions are centred on the scale of your project, as well as the quality of your interactions with your mentor and community. After the evaluation window closes, you, your mentor, and the org admins will receive an email informing you if you passed or not. Only your mentoring admins and programme administrators from iNeuron can see your evaluations. iNeuron's programme administrators may need to share some evaluation details with you and your mentor in specific instances. You are encouraged to do both evaluations, but you are only obliged to complete the final evaluation, which also includes your link to your work product. If you do not complete the final evaluation, you will fail the programme. If you fail an evaluation, you will be withdrawn from the GSoC programme immediately. Work Product Submission and Final Evaluations In addition to your evaluation, at the end of the iNeuron Code Fusion term, you must give a link to the work you made during your current ICF participation. Essentially, the link's target should contain a brief statement of what work was completed, what code was merged, what code was not merged, and what work remains. You may need to provide diffs between code you've written and code produced by others, or perhaps an entire branch of the code base, depending on what pieces of code are included in the scope of your project. Discuss this with your mentor and community, and make the best decision you can. Be Patient With Your Payments! Payments to your bank account or payment card are made after you complete your evaluations successfully. The processing time is a few business days. Please bear with us.","title":"Criteria for Evaluation"},{"location":"Criteria%20for%20Evaluation/#criteria-for-evaluation","text":"There are two rounds of evaluations (after 5 weeks and at the end of the 10th week of the coding period).

The last thing you want is to get into the coding phase only to discover that you don't have all of the tools you need installed and set to get started. Make sure this doesn't happen to you! The community bonding phase is the ideal opportunity to resolve these issues. Make sure your development environment is in good shape. To work with developers, each project requires its own set of tools and packages. These frequently include: Language interpreter compiler Editor of text System for version control The software's required modules and libraries a database, a mail server, or a web server Tool for real-time communication Some businesses require testing on a variety of operating systems and platforms. As soon as possible, make sure you understand what is expected of you. To figure out exactly what tools you need to succeed, read the available development documentation and contact your mentor. Also, become familiar with your company's bug-reporting procedure and the project's release management approach. Practice Start practising once you've set up your development environment. This involves learning about the open source project community's coding standards, codebase, testing, and documentation regulations. Make a few test commits to get a better grasp of how source control works in your project. Start by brushing up on any new abilities you've learned and asking questions. Conduct some preliminary research. Look through the project's bug database and the user list to get a sense of who your end users are. Examine the project's current documentation and the mailing list archives. Start interacting with others. Utilize the community bonding session to engage with your mentor and other programme participants. Create a blog, join relevant forums and email groups, and begin communicating with the development community in general. Make sure you have all you need to succeed, and if you don't, get assistance from your mentor. Begin collaborating with your classmates. Working with your mentor isn't the only aspect of ICF. There's also this incredible bunch of exceptional and ambitious students. They're the same as I am! Many students have suffered or are facing challenges similar to yours. Do not be afraid to ask questions. This is especially true for students accepted into the same organisations as you. You might inquire about how they set up their development environment. On IRC and mailing lists, help each other out. Don't be afraid to ask questions or to respond! Make friends from all across the world. The ICF is a fantastic platform for people and communities to collaborate across borders. Take advantage of this opportunity to learn more about different technology and civilizations while remaining respectful of the differences. Examine Your Project Schedule Do you have a solid project plan in place? Have you told your mentor about any upcoming absences?

Despite the fact that iNeuron provides a schedule to ensure that things are done on time, you and your mentor should create a bespoke time line that matches your project requirements. Period of Community Bonding There's already a whole section in the guide dedicated to this. (It's that critical.) Make the most of this time by getting to know your community, setting up your development environment, and getting a head start on code development. This is the period when you get to know your mentor as well as the other students. Chat with them on IRC, ask them questions, and discuss project ideas, and be ready for the exciting voyage ahead. Make a list of mini-goals for each week. Setting short-term goals that you can discuss with your mentor is usually beneficial. Breaking down your project into smaller tasks can benefit in a variety of ways, including: It gets you going!! You're working on a smaller, more defined task that's easier to manage. Mini-goals assist you plan out a path to the end product you want to develop. Smaller goals are less intimidating, and attaining one gives you the confidence to move on to the next. Make it clear what you'll be doing with your time. A weekly commitment of roughly 18 hours is required for GSoC. If you know ahead of time that you'll need to take a few days off during the Summer of Code, let your mentor know ahead of time and make plans to make up for lost time. You and your mentor have the option to add some flexibility to your 10-week programme; however, any planned breaks, etc., must be agreed upon by both of you. Meetings with your mentor on a regular basis You should absolutely, positively make sure you're communicating with your mentor on a regular basis through mutually agreed-upon means. It's critical that you and your mentor are on the same page about the project's status and goals. Your mentor is your most valuable resource, and you should make the most of him or her. Code reviews should be done on a regular basis. It's critical to do regular code reviews in order to stay on track. Don't be scared to request them as often as you require them. It's far preferable to request a code review after 10 or 20 lines rather than hundreds. You don't want to find out after writing a lot of useless code if your mentor tells you that you're doing anything incorrect. Keep a journal to keep track of your development. Keeping a progress log is an excellent way to keep track of your development for yourself, your mentor, and anybody else. It also comes in handy when you need to go back and evaluate a decision and figure out why you made it in the first place. Blogging is an excellent method to do this since you can get fantastic advise in the form of comments from individuals you wouldn't typically connect with, and it also puts you in the spotlight. Taking care of the time zone discrepancies Your tutor is almost certainly in a different time zone than you. Make sure you consider this when you're putting together your strategy. Any meeting schedules should include time zones, and UTC is frequently the ideal option because it is not influenced by Daylight Savings Time. Always be ready for the unexpected. The majority of the time, things do not go as planned. Make sure you have enough space to accommodate unanticipated adjustments. It's usually a good idea to set aside some buffer time in case you stray from your initial plan, since this will spare you a lot of agony and panic episodes.","title":"Managing Time for Students"},{"location":"Managing%20Time%20for%20Students/#managing-time-for-students","text":"Effective time management will go a long way toward ensuring that you get the most out of your ICF experience.

You are a good listener and responder to comments. The community-developed software paradigm relies significantly on constructive feedback and each contributor's willingness to accept criticism and improve the code. Your mentor will provide you with regular feedback - not all of it will be \"this is amazing\" or \"you are fantastic.\" A successful ICF student must be capable of learning from and politely receiving criticisms. You have the ability to work autonomously. Because you'll be working alone for a long time, it's critical that you don't be frightened to face the unknown and begin solving what may appear to be insurmountable difficulties on your own. You're aware of when it's appropriate to inquire. Do you believe you already know everything there is to know about open source programming? Then you're probably not cut out for ICF! Technical Skills Software packages can be installed and configured on your own. You'll need to learn how to download and install packages on your own right away if you don't already. You have 18 hours each week access to a working computer. You'll need to figure out if your computer dies frequently or if you don't have devoted access to a computer before you begin your project. GSoC requires a large time commitment; an hour or two a day in an internet cafe will not suffice! You've worked with the project's programming language and operating system before. The skills required will vary depending on the project, however you will need some previous experience. One of the best things about ICF is the wide range of organisations and projects from which to pick. There's a strong chance you'll be able to locate a project that meets you where you are. Even if you're a complete novice! If the project predominantly uses Linux for development and distribution, you should be familiar with the operating system. You may be able to bring in additional skills if you identify initiatives that are trying to expand into other platforms. Every project has its own set of criteria for selecting students and projects; but, if you match the above fundamental requirements, chances are you'll be able to find ICF projects and organisations to which you may apply. Pro tip: Don't be scared to apply to projects even if you only meet 51% of the requirements. Include a section on how you'll compensate for or gain the skills you're missing, and show that you're working on them during the application process.","title":"Should I Submit an Application to the ICF?"},{"location":"Should%20I%20Submit%20an%20Application%20to%20the%20ICF/#should-i-submit-an-application-to-the-icf","text":"Do you have any university-level programming experience?

One of the most valuable aspects of the ICF programme is consistent access to mentors. Your mentor will work with you throughout the ICF programme to ensure your success, but you must also ensure that you are contributing to and managing your mentor's relationship. Community Interaction Period The community bonding stage is when you finalize your project idea, organize frequent upcoming meetings with your mentor, set up your development environment, and begin to participate in the project. This is the moment to work with your mentor on establishing expectations for your interactions and determining how your success will be measured throughout the ICF programme. Hopefully, you and your mentor have had numerous meetings during the application period, clarifying the project and expectations, but now is the time to solidify your preparations. Maintaining Consistency You should have previously worked out a clear timetable with your mentor for frequent meetings, reports, code check-ins, and any planned time off. If you haven't already, do it right now! Your mentors are also folks who have a lot on their plates. They already have a lot on their plates, and IFC is just one more. Your project is nearly certain to fail if you rely only on your mentor to keep track of and enforce the work schedule. Maintain a proactive approach to sticking to the timetable you've agreed on and suggesting changes before deadlines pass. Be considerate of your mentor's time Your mentor is assisting you with your ICF project at no cost to you. Your mentor is unlikely to want to continue assisting you with your project if you regularly miss scheduled sessions without prior notice and fail to come prepared to meetings. Remember that your mentor is your most valuable resource in completing your project, so respect them as such. Making Use of Your Mentor During the coding phase, you should continue to employ your mentor as much as possible. Ask your mentor for input on the code as you implement each element of your project plan. Avoid spending two weeks working on a piece of code that is going in the wrong direction. Never be hesitant to ask questions, but keep in mind that you'll have a better chance of getting a good answer if you strive to be precise and conduct some preliminary research. Examine the logs and try to solve the issue or problem before seeking assistance. It's also crucial not to wait until you're considerably behind on your assignment before seeking assistance. Requesting and Receiving Feedback It's difficult to hear criticism. It's even more difficult not to react defensively. Getting critical feedback on your project from your mentor, the greater open source project community, and your peers is a useful exercise in helping you develop the best code possible.","title":"The Coding Begins"},{"location":"The%20Coding%20Begins/#the-coding-begins","text":"","title":"The Coding Begins"},{"location":"The%20Coding%20Begins/#working-with-your-mentor","text":"Once your project has been approved, you will be allocated a principal mentor and maybe supplementary mentors.

No. If you are interested in working for iNeuron, please visit the careers section in iNeuron's website. Is ICF considered an internship, a job, or any form of employment? No. ICF is an activity that the student performs as an independent developer for which they are paid a stipend. Do iNeuron use the code produced by students? No. While we hope that all the code that comes out of this program will find a happy home, we don\u2019t require organizations to use the student's' code. Where does ICF occur? iNeuron Code Fusion occurs entirely online; there is no requirement to travel as part of the program. What can I do to help spread the word about ICF? You can download flyers to post around your campus. You can also tweet about the program, make YouTube videos, or host a meetup or information session in your area. We also have a template email you can use to distribute to your community (school, developer, etc.) and other contacts. How do I organize or host a ICF information session or meetup? You are welcome to schedule an online session or meetup at whatever time and place is convenient for you! Please review the Program Rules first and utilize our presentation template and flyers. Can I participate in ICF as both a mentor and a student? No. We want to make sure that each project and student receives sufficient attention, and we feel this could create a bad experience for those involved. Please choose whether participation as a mentor or a student is more appealing to you and plan to apply accordingly. When can students apply for ICF? Please see the program timeline for more detailed information. What programming language(s) should I know to participate in ICF? The programming language you need to know depends on which project you are interested in working with. You should be familiar with the programming language(s) used by that organization. Can I submit more than one proposal? Yes, each student may submit up to three proposals. However, only one per student may be accepted. No more than one proposal per student will be accepted, no matter how many proposals you submit. Can students already working on an open source project continue to work on it as part of ICF? Yes, but students should be sure to note their previous relationship with the project in their proposals. Can a group submit a proposal together to work on a single project? No, only an individual may work on a given project. Should I send proposals directly to iNeuron? Yes, all proposals should be submitted to the program site. Proposals submitted outside of the iNeuron Code Fusion program site will not be considered for iNeuron Code Fusion. You are encouraged to reach out to the mentoring organization early to discuss your ideas and get feedback and a better understanding of the work they do before submitting your final proposal. Do I get paid for participating in ICF? Yes! iNeuron will provide a stipend to those students who successfully complete the program. Will I get paid even if the organization does not use my code? Yes, so long as the student passes their evaluation(s). Whether or not the project uses the produced code does not impact the student stipend. What does a good student proposal look like? The Student Guide has a section on \"Writing a Proposal\". The best proposals are from students who took the time to interact and discuss their ideas with the organization before submission. Be sure to include the following: detail on exactly what you're proposing, why you're proposing it, the reason you're qualified to do it, and your development methodology. It should also include details of your academic, industry, and/or open source development experience. How much time does ICF participation take? The ICF 2021 program is 12+ weeks long and students are expected to spend on average 18 hours a week on the program. Depending on your skills and the difficulty of your project it may take you more or less than 18 hours a week to meet the goals of your project.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"faq/#is-ineuron-code-fusion-icf-a-recruiting-program","text":"No. If you are interested in working for iNeuron, please visit the careers section in iNeuron's website.","title":"Is iNeuron Code Fusion (ICF) a recruiting program?"},{"location":"faq/#is-icf-considered-an-internship-a-job-or-any-form-of-employment","text":"No. ICF is an activity that the student performs as an independent developer for which they are paid a stipend.","title":"Is ICF considered an internship, a job, or any form of employment?"},{"location":"faq/#do-ineuron-use-the-code-produced-by-students","text":"No. While we hope that all the code that comes out of this program will find a happy home, we don\u2019t require organizations to use the student's' code.","title":"Do iNeuron use the code produced by students?"},{"location":"faq/#where-does-icf-occur","text":"iNeuron Code Fusion occurs entirely online; there is no requirement to travel as part of the program.","title":"Where does ICF occur?"},{"location":"faq/#what-can-i-do-to-help-spread-the-word-about-icf","text":"You can download flyers to post around your campus.

Mechanisms to assure the quality of the study \u2013 e.g. control of bias, safe storage of data Study period - Timetable for completion of the project Participants in the study \u2013 all people involved in the study, and the role they play, should be identified. Ethical considerations Resources required for the study, including budget if applicable References Appendices (copy of questionnaire, consent forms, etc.)","title":"The research proposal template"},{"location":"pro-template/#how-to-use-this-template","text":"The template provides ALL the sections, headings and subheadings that you will require in your proposal, as well as the line and paragraph spacing, page breaks, page numbering, referencing system and referencing styles. You should simply edit the text where appropriate and insert your own text as per your proposal, i.e simply type into the document. Do not attempt to change the styles for the headings or subheadings, and do not attempt to use more than three level headings (i.e A main heading, a sub-heading and a sub-sub-heading). If you feel you are sufficiently computer literate, you could add this template to your Templates directory in your Office system files. This will allow you to select this template at any time in the future when you prepare proposals. To do this, go to the \u201cMenu Bar\u201d, select File > Save As\u2026, when the dialog box appears, at the bottom, under \u201csave as type\u201d, select \u201cDocument Template\u201d. The MS Office Templates directory automatically appears. You could name your file \u201cProposal Template\u201d (which should appear as a default in the dialog box, at the bottom, under \u201cSave As\u201d). Your template is now saved in the C:\\Documents and Settings\\User\\Application Data\\Microsoft\\Templates directory. When you next wish to use this template, click on File > New, the \u201ctask pane\u201d that appears on the right side of your screen will prompt you to use a template, click on \u201con my computer\u2026\u201d, and from the dialog box that appears, select your template \u201cProposal Template\u201d. This brings up the template with all its saved fonts, paragraph settings etc. Once again, simply insert your text, and this time, save your file normally, and NOT as a template!
