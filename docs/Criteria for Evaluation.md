# Criteria for Evaluation

There are two rounds of evaluations (after 5 weeks and at the end of the 10th week of the coding period). We provide you the chance to assess your mentor's performance. This is also an opportunity for your mentor to assess you.

It should not be surprising if an evaluation results in a pass or fail. You and your mentor should already be interacting, and you should be talking about the quality of your code, your involvement in the community, and your progress on your project thus far. If you aren't getting this kind of feedback, you should request it.

## How Do Evaluation Work?

* During the evaluation period, you and your mentor will both fill out an evaluation survey. iNeuron makes the evaluation questions available to both students and mentors ahead of time.

* The webapp you used to submit your project proposal at the start of the term is utilized to administer evaluations. It will take roughly 10-15 minutes to complete the evaluations. The questions are centred on the scale of your project, as well as the quality of your interactions with your mentor and community. After the evaluation window closes, you, your mentor, and the org admins will receive an email informing you if you passed or not.

* Only your mentoring admins and programme administrators from iNeuron can see your evaluations. iNeuron's programme administrators may need to share some evaluation details with you and your mentor in specific instances. 

* You are encouraged to do both evaluations, but you are only obliged to complete the final evaluation, which also includes your link to your work product. If you do not complete the final evaluation, you will fail the programme. If you fail an evaluation, you will be withdrawn from the GSoC programme immediately.

## Work Product Submission and Final Evaluations

* In addition to your evaluation, at the end of the iNeuron Code Fusion term, you must give a link to the work you made during your current ICF participation. Essentially, the link's target should contain a brief statement of what work was completed, what code was merged, what code was not merged, and what work remains.

* You may need to provide diffs between code you've written and code produced by others, or perhaps an entire branch of the code base, depending on what pieces of code are included in the scope of your project. Discuss this with your mentor and community, and make the best decision you can.

## Be Patient With Your Payments!

Payments to your bank account or payment card are made after you complete your evaluations successfully. The processing time is a few business days. Please bear with us.
