# iNeuron Code Fusion (iCF)

## About
iNeuron Code Fusion is a global programme that allows you to submit a research proposal concept and collaborate on open source software development with student developers. During their break from school or work, students work on a 3-5 month project with an open source initiative.

Student participants are partnered with a mentor from the leads of successful projects as part of iNeuron Code Fusion, gaining exposure to real-world software development and practices. Students can earn a stipend while working on projects that are linked to their interests over the summer between semesters.

As a result, iNeuron aids in the identification and recruitment of new developers who will implement new features and, perhaps, continue to contribute to open source long after the programme has ended. Most significantly, more code is written and released for everyone's benefit.


## What is iNeuron Code Fusion?
 
iNeuron Code Fusion (ICF) is a global programme that connects students, industry, incubators, researchers, innovator and developer community with open source, free software, and technology-related initiatives where they can develop a solution and contribute to the open-source community while getting various rewards and recognitions along with opportunity to win prizes. 

Mentors from iNeuron serve as advisors throughout the process, from learning about the community to contributing code. The goal is to engage student and industry to build state of the art things and take the advantages.

Accepted students and industry will get a platform where they can innovate collaborate work on state of the art projects and build end to end solution for community as well as individual industry. Participating organizations are able to identify and recruit new developers into their communities, with the intention that they will remain active long after their iCF year has ended. 

Most importantly, more source code is written and released for the benefit of all. All the work done as part of the programme is released under an open source licence. How great is it that you get to work on a project that can be used by people all across the world?

## Program Objectives
 
The ICF programme has a number of objectives:

* Motivate young developers to be involved in open source development.

* Assist open source projects in identifying and recruiting new contributors

* More open source code should be produced and shared for everyone's benefit.

* Allow students to work on projects that are connected to their academic goals.

* Give students more hands-on experience with software development in the real world (for example, distributed development and version control, software licencing issues, testing, and communication best practices).
