# Should I Submit an Application to the ICF?

Do you have any university-level programming experience? Then, certainly, you are qualified! No, you don't have to be a Computer Science or Information Technology major to apply. Successful ICF students come from a variety of academic backgrounds. Do you have programming skills but spend your time studying philosophy full-time? Yes, you have what it takes to be an ICF student!

Every project has its own set of criteria for selecting students, as well as its own set of skill requirements.

If you have the following general abilities, you should be able to identify a ICF project to which you can apply:

### Soft abilities

You figure out where to go for technical assistance. There are numerous resources accessible on the internet to assist with technical concerns; but, knowing how to use a search engine to begin your search is critical.

## You are a good listener and responder to comments.

The community-developed software paradigm relies significantly on constructive feedback and each contributor's willingness to accept criticism and improve the code. Your mentor will provide you with regular feedback - not all of it will be "this is amazing" or "you are fantastic." A successful ICF student must be capable of learning from and politely receiving criticisms.

## You have the ability to work autonomously.

Because you'll be working alone for a long time, it's critical that you don't be frightened to face the unknown and begin solving what may appear to be insurmountable difficulties on your own.

## You're aware of when it's appropriate to inquire.

Do you believe you already know everything there is to know about open source programming? Then you're probably not cut out for ICF!


##  Technical Skills

### Software packages can be installed and configured on your own.

You'll need to learn how to download and install packages on your own right away if you don't already.

### You have 18 hours each week access to a working computer.

You'll need to figure out if your computer dies frequently or if you don't have devoted access to a computer before you begin your project. GSoC requires a large time commitment; an hour or two a day in an internet cafe will not suffice!

### You've worked with the project's programming language and operating system before.

The skills required will vary depending on the project, however you will need some previous experience. One of the best things about ICF is the wide range of organisations and projects from which to pick. There's a strong chance you'll be able to locate a project that meets you where you are. Even if you're a complete novice! If the project predominantly uses Linux for development and distribution, you should be familiar with the operating system. You may be able to bring in additional skills if you identify initiatives that are trying to expand into other platforms.

Every project has its own set of criteria for selecting students and projects; but, if you match the above fundamental requirements, chances are you'll be able to find ICF projects and organisations to which you may apply.

Pro tip: Don't be scared to apply to projects even if you only meet 51% of the requirements. Include a section on how you'll compensate for or gain the skills you're missing, and show that you're working on them during the application process.
