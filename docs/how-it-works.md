# How-it-works?

## Students
 
Students contact iNeuron to work with and develop a summer project proposal. Before beginning coding, students spend a few weeks integrating with their companies if they are approved. After that, students have 12-20 weeks to code while adhering to the deadlines set by their mentors.
 
## Idea Pitchers
 
Open source project ideas should only be submitted to iNeuron. Once accepted, iNeuron will brainstorm ideas with the leads before deciding which proposals to mentor during the summer. They assign mentors to each student to assist them in completing the programme.
 
## Mentors
 
Mentoring a student project is an option for existing contributors to the organisations. Mentors and students collaborate to develop appropriate summer milestones and criteria. Interaction with mentors is an important aspect of the curriculum.
