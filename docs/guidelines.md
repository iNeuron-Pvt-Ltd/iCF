# A general guideline to choose a project

1. Your skills vs skills required: Make sure you at least have familiarity with the skills required to complete the project or you can learn about them in a decent amount of time. 
2. What are your professional interests?: Make sure the project aligns with your professional interests
3. What your hobbies?
4. What are your expectations from the project?
5. Ask questions about the projects that may interest you?
6. Make a list of such projects and evaluate them based on your skills and interests and then write a proposal.
7. Try to submit your proposal early which will contain the project ideas or flow of work that you think is a good approach to solve that problem. Early submissions can help you to get feedback early from your mentors.
