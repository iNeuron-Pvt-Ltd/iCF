# How to Get a Head Start in ICF?

The last thing you want is to get into the coding phase only to discover that you don't have all of the tools you need installed and set to get started. Make sure this doesn't happen to you! The community bonding phase is the ideal opportunity to resolve these issues.

## Make sure your development environment is in good shape.

To work with developers, each project requires its own set of tools and packages. These frequently include:

* Language interpreter compiler
* Editor of text
* System for version control
* The software's required modules and libraries
* a database, a mail server, or a web server
* Tool for real-time communication



Some businesses require testing on a variety of operating systems and platforms. As soon as possible, make sure you understand what is expected of you. To figure out exactly what tools you need to succeed, read the available development documentation and contact your mentor. Also, become familiar with your company's bug-reporting procedure and the project's release management approach.

## Practice 

Start practising once you've set up your development environment. This involves learning about the open source project community's coding standards, codebase, testing, and documentation regulations. Make a few test commits to get a better grasp of how source control works in your project. Start by brushing up on any new abilities you've learned and asking questions.

## Conduct some preliminary research.

Look through the project's bug database and the user list to get a sense of who your end users are. Examine the project's current documentation and the mailing list archives.

## Start interacting with others.

Utilize the community bonding session to engage with your mentor and other programme participants. Create a blog, join relevant forums and email groups, and begin communicating with the development community in general. Make sure you have all you need to succeed, and if you don't, get assistance from your mentor.

## Begin collaborating with your classmates.

Working with your mentor isn't the only aspect of ICF. There's also this incredible bunch of exceptional and ambitious students.

### They're the same as I am!

Many students have suffered or are facing challenges similar to yours. Do not be afraid to ask questions. This is especially true for students accepted into the same organisations as you. You might inquire about how they set up their development environment. On IRC and mailing lists, help each other out. Don't be afraid to ask questions or to respond!

### Make friends from all across the world.

The ICF is a fantastic platform for people and communities to collaborate across borders. Take advantage of this opportunity to learn more about different technology and civilizations while remaining respectful of the differences.

### Examine Your Project Schedule

Do you have a solid project plan in place? Have you told your mentor about any upcoming absences? Make any project adjustments you now see fit, depending on your current understanding of how the project works and your setup of your dev environment.
